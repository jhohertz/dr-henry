I went to make a post on my [main blog](http://jhohertz.github.io/), and found there were errors, and had a look at what's changed on the [dependency versions](https://pages.github.com/versions/) page, and I see everything's been upgrade, and Jekyll 2 support is available!

This post is half a test to see if a simple post works or not, and half a notice there will (and may need to be) updates to Dr. Henry to support the new platform.
