I went to make a post on my [main blog](http://jhohertz.github.io/), and found there were errors, and had a look at what's changed on the [dependency versions](https://pages.github.com/versions/) page, and I see everything's been upgrade, and Jekyll 2 support is available!

This post is half a test to see if a simple post works or not, and half a notice there will (and may need to be) updates to Dr. Henry to support the new platform.

Looks like the only issue was with a stray quote mark that the new Jekyll didn't like... the develop branch has the fix, and I'll be revitting things shortly to take advantage of the new features we can take advantage of!
