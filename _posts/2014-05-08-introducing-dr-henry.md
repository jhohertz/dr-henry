### What is Dr. Henry?

After recently deciding to use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for project sites, and personal blogging, I've been looking at the various options available to build sites.

Two main projects stood out. [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) is very nice, feature rich, but requires rendering locally, with the output pushed to GitHub, which is not a workflow I wanted. Then there is [jekyll-bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/), which satisfies the workflow requirement, has a fair bit of components developed, but is not actively maintained by the author, lacks a good home/category landing, and so on.

So Dr. Henry starts it's life as a fork of jekyll-bootstrap. Why a name change? I expect I may drift away from the upstream, however, I've kept parallel branches to the upstream in case this can all get merged up.

So don't expect a lot just yet, you are probably better off with jekyll-bootstrap for now. But if you'd like to look, checkout the [repository](https://github.com/jhohertz/dr-henry) page.

Updates on the progress will be posted right here, under itself as it develops. :)
