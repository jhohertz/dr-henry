#markdown: redcarpet	# has bugs
markdown: kramdown	# github's suggestion

# This is the full set of plugins that GitHub supports
gems:
  - jekyll-sitemap
  - jekyll-redirect-from
  - jekyll-mentions
  - jemoji

# This will eventually be a list instead, for chaining parent themes.

theme: jekb

# If publishing to a subdirectory as in http://site.com/project set 'root: /project'
# Must not have trailing slash, IE: '/project/'
root: /

# The production_url is only used when full-domain names are needed
# such as sitemap.txt 
# Most places will/should use root_url to make the urls
# Links in your website should always be prefixed with {{ root_url }}
#
# If you have set a CNAME (pages.github.com) set your custom domain here.
# Else if you are pushing to username.github.io, replace with your username.
# Finally if you are pushing to a GitHub project page, include the project name at the end.
#
production_url : http://username.github.io

# This is the default format.
